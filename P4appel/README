To run:
	make			- to compile
	compile <file>		- file can have .fs19 extension or not
	make clean		- erase all executables

Files that work:
	P4_multiply.fs19
	P4_test0G.fs19
	P4_test10.fs19
	P4_test1B.fs19
	P4_test1G.fs19
	P4_test2B.fs19
	P4_test2G.fs19
	P4_test3G.fs19
	P4_test4G.fs19
	P4_test5G.fs19
	P4_test6G.fs19
	P4_test7G.fs19
	
Files that don't work:
	P4_neg.fs19 (receive seg fault)
	P4_pos.fs19 (seg fault)
	P4_test8.fs19 (seg fault)
	P4_test9G.fs19 (seg fault)
	P4_big_cahuna.fs19 (seg fault)

Output files:
	they all end in .asm

Problems:
	I got segmentation faults in my P3 that I could never figure out, so they carried on to P4, unfortunately.
	I suspect it had something to do with the "cond" or "loop" statement because those were the files that seemed to be seg faulting and right in that area.
	I didn't have enough time to figure it out though.
